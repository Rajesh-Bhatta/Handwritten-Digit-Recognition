# Digit Recognition Project

This project implements a Hanwritten Digit Recognition system using machine learning techniques and implementation using CNN.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajesh-Bhatta/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition.git
   cd Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Digit Recognization.ipynb
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells.
## Files
`Digit Recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the digit recognition system.  <br>
`requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the code.  <br>
`README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the project.
## Usage
Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to train the model and evaluate its performance.  <br>
Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different configurations as needed.
